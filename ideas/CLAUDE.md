# Business Ideas Context

## Goal
Generate, evaluate, and prioritize business ideas worth building.

## Evaluation Framework
Score each idea 1-5 on:
- **Pain** — how acute is the problem?
- **Market** — how many people have this problem?
- **Edge** — why can Jason build/sell this better than others?
- **Speed** — how fast to first dollar?
- **Moat** — defensibility over time?

## Idea Pipeline
Ideas live in `ideas.db` (SQLite) with status: raw → evaluated → validated → building → dead

## Research Tools
- `brave-search` — competitor research, market size
- `fetch` — scrape Product Hunt, HN, Reddit for pain points
- `sequential-thinking` — structured evaluation sessions

## Active Ideas (fill in)
(Use memory MCP to persist and retrieve ideas across sessions)
